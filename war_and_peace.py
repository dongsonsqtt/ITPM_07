war_and_peace = "CHAPTER I<quote>Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of theBuonapartes. But I warn you, if you don<singlequote>t tell me that this means war,if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by thatAntichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothingmore to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my‘faithful slave,<singlequote> as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see Ihave frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.<quote>It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna PávlovnaSchérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna.With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of highrank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. AnnaPávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, sufferingfrom la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, usedonly by the elite.All her invitations without exception, written in French, and deliveredby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:<quote>If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if theprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—AnnetteSchérer.<quote><quote>Heavens! what a virulent attack!<quote> replied the prince, not in theleast disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing anembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars onhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in thatrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, andwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importancewho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna,kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,and complacently seated himself on the sofa.<quote>First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend<singlequote>smind at rest,<quote> said he without altering his tone, beneath thepoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even ironycould be discerned.<quote>Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in timeslike these if one has any feeling?<quote> said Anna Pávlovna. <quote>You arestaying the whole evening, I hope?<quote><quote>And the fete at the English ambassador<singlequote>s? Today is Wednesday. Imust put in an appearance there,<quote> said the prince. <quote>My daughter iscoming for me to take me there.<quote><quote>I thought today<singlequote>s fete had been canceled. I confess all thesefestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.<quote><quote>If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would havebeen put off,<quote> said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by forceof habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.<quote>Don<singlequote>t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev<singlequote>sdispatch? You know everything.<quote><quote>What can one say about it?<quote> replied the prince in a cold, listlesstone. <quote>What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte hasburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.<quote>Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stalepart. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years,overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast hadbecome her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did notfeel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint theexpectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though itdid not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, tocorrect.In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burstout:<quote>Oh, don<singlequote>t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don<singlequote>t understandthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. Sheis betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereignrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the onething I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to performthe noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God willnot forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra ofrevolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person ofthis murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the justone.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercialspirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander<singlequote>sloftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted tofind, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answerdid Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannotunderstand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing forhimself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have theypromised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will notperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, andthat all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don<singlequote>t believe aword that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussianneutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the loftydestiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!<quote>She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.<quote>I think,<quote> said the prince with a smile, <quote>that if you had beensent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the Kingof Prussia<singlequote>s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give mea cup of tea?<quote><quote>In a moment. À propos,<quote> she added, becoming calm again, <quote>I amexpecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, whois connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the bestFrench families. He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones. Andalso the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has beenreceived by the Emperor. Had you heard?<quote><quote>I shall be delighted to meet them,<quote> said the prince. <quote>Buttell me,<quote> he added with studied carelessness as if it had only justoccurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chiefmotive of his visit, <quote>is it true that the Dowager Empress wantsBaron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by allaccounts is a poor creature.<quote>Prince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others weretrying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it forthe baron.Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she noranyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or waspleased with.<quote>Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by hersister,<quote> was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna<singlequote>s face suddenly assumed anexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled withsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustriouspatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funkebeaucoup d<singlequote>estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly andcourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovnawished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a manrecommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so shesaid:<quote>Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter cameout everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazinglybeautiful.<quote>The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.<quote>I often think,<quote> she continued after a short pause, drawing nearerto the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that politicaland social topics were ended and the time had come for intimateconversation—<quote>I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of lifeare distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children?I don<singlequote>t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don<singlequote>t like him,<quote> sheadded in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.<quote>Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less thananyone, and so you don<singlequote>t deserve to have them.<quote>And she smiled her ecstatic smile.<quote>I can<singlequote>t help it,<quote> said the prince. <quote>Lavater would have said Ilack the bump of paternity.<quote><quote>Don<singlequote>t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you knowI am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves<quote> (and herface assumed its melancholy expression), <quote>he was mentioned at HerMajesty<singlequote>s and you were pitied....<quote>The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,awaiting a reply. He frowned.<quote>What would you have me do?<quote> he said at last. <quote>You know I did alla father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. Thatis the only difference between them.<quote> He said this smiling in a waymore natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles roundhis mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse andunpleasant.<quote>And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not afather there would be nothing I could reproach you with,<quote> said AnnaPávlovna, looking up pensively.<quote>I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that mychildren are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. Thatis how I explain it to myself. It can<singlequote>t be helped!<quote>He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by agesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated.<quote>Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?<quote> sheasked. <quote>They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though Idon<singlequote>t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person whois very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, PrincessMary Bolkónskaya.<quote>Prince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory andperception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement ofthe head that he was considering this information.<quote>Do you know,<quote> he said at last, evidently unable to check the sadcurrent of his thoughts, <quote>that Anatole is costing me forty thousandrubles a year? And,<quote> he went on after a pause, <quote>what will it be infive years, if he goes on like this?<quote> Presently he added: <quote>That<singlequote>swhat we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yoursrich?<quote><quote>Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He isthe well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army underthe late Emperor, and was nicknamed ‘the King of Prussia.<singlequote> He isvery clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy.She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.He is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov<singlequote>s and will be here tonight.<quote><quote>Listen, dear Annette,<quote> said the prince, suddenly taking AnnaPávlovna<singlequote>s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. <quote>Arrangethat affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafewith an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is richand of good family and that<singlequote>s all I want.<quote>And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised themaid of honor<singlequote>s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and froas he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.<quote>Attendez,<quote> said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, <quote>I<singlequote>ll speak toLise, young Bolkónski<singlequote>s wife, this very evening, and perhaps thething can be arranged. It shall be on your family<singlequote>s behalf that I<singlequote>llstart my apprenticeship as old maid.<quote>CHAPTER IIAnna Pávlovna<singlequote>s drawing room was gradually filling. The highestPetersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in ageand character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.Prince Vasíli<singlequote>s daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to take herfather to the ambassador<singlequote>s entertainment; she wore a ball dress andher badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkónskaya,known as la femme la plus séduisante de Pétersbourg, * was also there.She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant didnot go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. PrinceVasíli<singlequote>s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.The Abbé Morio and many others had also come.     * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.To each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, <quote>You have not yet seen myaunt,<quote> or <quote>You do not know my aunt?<quote> and very gravely conductedhim or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in hercap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guestsbegan to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to heraunt, Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one<singlequote>s name and then left them.Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom notone of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of themcared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful andsolemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them inthe same words, about their health and her own, and the health of HerMajesty, <quote>who, thank God, was better today.<quote> And each visitor,though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old womanwith a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did notreturn to her the whole evening.The young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in agold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which adelicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth,but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when sheoccasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the casewith a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect—the shortness of herupper lip and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her own special andpeculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this prettyyoung woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, andcarrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young oneswho looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her alittle while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of lifeand health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smileand the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in aspecially amiable mood that day.The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swayingsteps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress satdown on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was apleasure to herself and to all around her. <quote>I have brought my work,<quote>said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.<quote>Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,<quote>she added, turning to her hostess. <quote>You wrote that it was to be quitea small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.<quote> And shespread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty graydress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.<quote>Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyoneelse,<quote> replied Anna Pávlovna.<quote>You know,<quote> said the princess in the same tone of voice and still inFrench, turning to a general, <quote>my husband is deserting me? He is goingto get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?<quote> sheadded, addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an answer sheturned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène.<quote>What a delightful woman this little princess is!<quote> said PrinceVasíli to Anna Pávlovna.One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man withclose-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionableat that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stoutyoung man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-knowngrandee of Catherine<singlequote>s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young manhad not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had onlyjust returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was hisfirst appearance in society. Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod sheaccorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite ofthis lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sightof something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her facewhen she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger thanthe other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference tothe clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression whichdistinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.<quote>It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poorinvalid,<quote> said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with heraunt as she conducted him to her.Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round asif in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the littleprincess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.Anna Pávlovna<singlequote>s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from theaunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty<singlequote>s health.Anna Pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: <quote>Do you know theAbbé Morio? He is a most interesting man.<quote><quote>Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is veryinteresting but hardly feasible.<quote><quote>You think so?<quote> rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say somethingand get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre nowcommitted a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady beforeshe had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak toanother who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feetspread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé<singlequote>splan chimerical.<quote>We will talk of it later,<quote> said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, sheresumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, readyto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. Asthe foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goesround and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one thatcreaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check themachine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about herdrawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by aword or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety aboutPierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approachedthe group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, andagain when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé.Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at AnnaPávlovna<singlequote>s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that allthe intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like achild in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missingany clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confidentand refined expression on the faces of those present he was alwaysexpecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio.Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for anopportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.CHAPTER IIIAnna Pávlovna<singlequote>s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummedsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn facewas rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company hadsettled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed roundthe abbé. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautifulPrincess Hélène, Prince Vasíli<singlequote>s daughter, and the little PrincessBolkónskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polishedmanners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out ofpoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up asa treat to her guests. As a clever maître d<singlequote>hôtel serves up as aspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it inthe kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up toher guests, first the vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choicemorsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing themurder of the Duc d<singlequote>Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d<singlequote>Enghienhad perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particularreasons for Buonaparte<singlequote>s hatred of him.<quote>Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,<quote> said Anna Pávlovna,with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la Louis XV in thesound of that sentence: <quote>Contez nous çela, Vicomte.<quote>The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness tocomply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone tolisten to his tale.<quote>The vicomte knew the duc personally,<quote> whispered Anna Pávlovna toone of the guests. <quote>The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,<quote> said sheto another. <quote>How evidently he belongs to the best society,<quote> said sheto a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicestand most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beefon a hot dish.The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.<quote>Come over here, Hélène, dear,<quote> said Anna Pávlovna to thebeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center ofanother group.The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with whichshe had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautifulwoman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with mossand ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparklingdiamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not lookingat any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each theprivilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders,back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very muchexposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her asshe moved toward Anna Pávlovna. Hélène was so lovely that not onlydid she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she evenappeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. Sheseemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.<quote>How lovely!<quote> said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted hisshoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinarywhen she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with herunchanging smile.<quote>Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,<quote> said he,smilingly inclining his head.The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considereda reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story wasbeing told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still morebeautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From timeto time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the storyproduced an effect she glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted justthe expression she saw on the maid of honor<singlequote>s face, and again relapsedinto her radiant smile.The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène.<quote>Wait a moment, I<singlequote>ll get my work.... Now then, what are youthinking of?<quote> she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. <quote>Fetch me myworkbag.<quote>There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in herseat.<quote>Now I am all right,<quote> she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, shetook up her work.Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle andmoving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblanceto his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite ofthis resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like hissister<singlequote>s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by thewonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrarywas dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullenself-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, andmouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his armsand legs always fell into unnatural positions.<quote>It<singlequote>s not going to be a ghost story?<quote> said he, sitting down besidethe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speak.<quote>Why no, my dear fellow,<quote> said the astonished narrator, shrugginghis shoulders.<quote>Because I hate ghost stories,<quote> said Prince Hippolyte in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after hehad uttered them.He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be surewhether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed ina dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nympheeffrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,to the effect that the Duc d<singlequote>Enghien had gone secretly to Paris tovisit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte,who also enjoyed the famous actress<singlequote> favors, and that in his presenceNapoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he wassubject, and was thus at the duc<singlequote>s mercy. The latter spared him, andthis magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies lookedagitated.<quote>Charming!<quote> said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at thelittle princess.<quote>Charming!<quote> whispered the little princess, sticking the needle intoher work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the storyprevented her from going on with it.The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he wastalking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to therescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé aboutthe balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the youngman<singlequote>s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Bothwere talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was whyAnna Pávlovna disapproved.<quote>The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights ofthe people,<quote> the abbé was saying. <quote>It is only necessary for onepowerful nation like Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to placeherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its objectthe maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save theworld!<quote><quote>But how are you to get that balance?<quote> Pierre was beginning.At that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian<singlequote>sface instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugaryexpression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.<quote>I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have hadthe honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think ofthe climate,<quote> said he.Not letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the moreconveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into thelarger circle.CHAPTER IVJust then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince AndrewBolkónski, the little princess<singlequote> husband. He was a very handsome youngman, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything abouthim, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It wasevident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but hadfound them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen tothem. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemedto bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away fromher with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed AnnaPávlovna<singlequote>s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.<quote>You are off to the war, Prince?<quote> said Anna Pávlovna.<quote>General Kutúzov,<quote> said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressingthe last syllable of the general<singlequote>s name like a Frenchman, <quote>has beenpleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....<quote><quote>And Lise, your wife?<quote><quote>She will go to the country.<quote><quote>Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?<quote><quote>André,<quote> said his wife, addressing her husband in the samecoquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, <quote>the vicomte hasbeen telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!<quote>Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who fromthe moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked roundPrince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever wastouching his arm, but when he saw Pierre<singlequote>s beaming face he gave him anunexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.<quote>There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?<quote> said he toPierre.<quote>I knew you would be here,<quote> replied Pierre. <quote>I will come to supperwith you. May I?<quote> he added in a low voice so as not to disturb thevicomte who was continuing his story.<quote>No, impossible!<quote> said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressingPierre<singlequote>s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. Hewished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and hisdaughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.<quote>You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,<quote> said Prince Vasíli to theFrenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to preventhis rising. <quote>This unfortunate fete at the ambassador<singlequote>s deprives meof a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leaveyour enchanting party,<quote> said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.His daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightlyholding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still moreradiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.<quote>Very lovely,<quote> said Prince Andrew.<quote>Very,<quote> said Pierre.In passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre<singlequote>s hand and said to AnnaPávlovna: <quote>Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with mea whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of cleverwomen.<quote>Anna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew hisfather to be a connection of Prince Vasíli<singlequote>s. The elderly lady whohad been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook PrinceVasíli in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumedhad left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxietyand fear.<quote>How about my son Borís, Prince?<quote> said she, hurrying after him intothe anteroom. <quote>I can<singlequote>t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me whatnews I may take back to my poor boy.<quote>Although Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politelyto the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him aningratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not goaway.<quote>What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then hewould be transferred to the Guards at once?<quote> said she.<quote>Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,<quote> answered PrinceVasíli, <quote>but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I shouldadvise you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That wouldbe the best way.<quote>The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of thebest families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out ofsociety had lost her former influential connections. She had now come toPetersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained aninvitation to Anna Pávlovna<singlequote>s reception and had sat listening tothe vicomte<singlequote>s story. Prince Vasíli<singlequote>s words frightened her, anembittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasíli<singlequote>s arm more tightly.<quote>Listen to me, Prince,<quote> said she. <quote>I have never yet asked youfor anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of myfather<singlequote>s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God<singlequote>s sake todo this for my son—and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,<quote>she added hurriedly. <quote>No, don<singlequote>t be angry, but promise! I have askedGolítsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,<quote>she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.<quote>Papa, we shall be late,<quote> said Princess Hélène, turning herbeautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as shestood waiting by the door.Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economizedif it is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realizedthat if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon beunable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. Butin Princess Drubetskáya<singlequote>s case he felt, after her second appeal,something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what wasquite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps inhis career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one ofthose women—mostly mothers—who, having once made up their minds,will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared ifnecessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and evento make scenes. This last consideration moved him.<quote>My dear Anna Mikháylovna,<quote> said he with his usual familiarity andweariness of tone, <quote>it is almost impossible for me to do what youask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father<singlequote>smemory, I will do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to theGuards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?<quote><quote>My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you—I knew yourkindness!<quote> He turned to go.<quote>Wait—just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...<quote>she faltered. <quote>You are on good terms with Michael IlariónovichKutúzov ... recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be atrest, and then...<quote>Prince Vasíli smiled.<quote>No, I won<singlequote>t promise that. You don<singlequote>t know how Kutúzov is pesteredsince his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself thatall the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons asadjutants.<quote><quote>No, but do promise! I won<singlequote>t let you go! My dear benefactor...<quote><quote>Papa,<quote> said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,<quote>we shall be late.<quote><quote>Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?<quote><quote>Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?<quote><quote>Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don<singlequote>t promise.<quote><quote>Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!<quote> cried Anna Mikháylovna as hewent, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probablycame naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employedall the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her faceresumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to thegroup where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended tolisten, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task wasaccomplished.CHAPTER V<quote>And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation atMilan?<quote> asked Anna Pávlovna, <quote>and of the comedy of the people ofGenoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, andMonsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions ofthe nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one<singlequote>s head whirl! It is asif the whole world had gone crazy.<quote>Prince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with asarcastic smile.<quote>‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!<singlequote><singlequote> * They say he wasvery fine when he said that,<quote> he remarked, repeating the words inItalian: <quote>‘Dio mi l<singlequote>ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!<singlequote><singlequote>     * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!<quote>I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass runover,<quote> Anna Pávlovna continued. <quote>The sovereigns will not be able toendure this man who is a menace to everything.<quote><quote>The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,<quote> said the vicomte, politebut hopeless: <quote>The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for LouisXVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!<quote> and he becamemore animated. <quote>And believe me, they are reaping the reward of theirbetrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sendingambassadors to compliment the usurper.<quote>And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some timethrough his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward thelittle princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condécoat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravityas if she had asked him to do it.<quote>Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d<singlequote>azur—maison Condé,<quote>said he.The princess listened, smiling.<quote>If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,<quote> thevicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with whichhe is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others butfollows the current of his own thoughts, <quote>things will have gone toofar. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society—Imean good French society—will have been forever destroyed, andthen....<quote>He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished tomake a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna,who had him under observation, interrupted:<quote>The Emperor Alexander,<quote> said she, with the melancholy whichalways accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, <quote>hasdeclared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choosetheir own form of government; and I believe that once free from theusurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the armsof its rightful king,<quote> she concluded, trying to be amiable to theroyalist emigrant.<quote>That is doubtful,<quote> said Prince Andrew. <quote>Monsieur le Vicomte quiterightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it willbe difficult to return to the old regime.<quote><quote>From what I have heard,<quote> said Pierre, blushing and breaking intothe conversation, <quote>almost all the aristocracy has already gone over toBonaparte<singlequote>s side.<quote><quote>It is the Buonapartists who say that,<quote> replied the vicomte withoutlooking at Pierre. <quote>At the present time it is difficult to know thereal state of French public opinion.<quote><quote>Bonaparte has said so,<quote> remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcasticsmile.It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming hisremarks at him, though without looking at him.<quote>‘I showed them the path to glory, but they did not followit,<singlequote><quote> Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quotingNapoleon<singlequote>s words. <quote>‘I opened my antechambers and they crowdedin.<singlequote> I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.<quote><quote>Not in the least,<quote> replied the vicomte. <quote>After the murder of theduc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to somepeople,<quote> he went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, <quote>he ever was a hero,after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one"
